# faculty-affiliation

The faculty at the University of California come from very diverse educational backgrounds.
The Daily Californian collected undergraduate and graduate education information for Berkeley faculty. Below, we display that information and further break it down into faculty by department. We found that while our profes sors have completed their undergraduate studies at a variety of institutions, they have been hired to teach at Berkeley from much more selective graduate programs.
Note: For faculty for whom data has not been available, their institutions are indicated as "unknown".
